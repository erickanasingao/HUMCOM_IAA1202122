<h3 style="text-align: center;"><u><b> by: Diane Hoh</i></b></u></h3>

<p><font color= "red"><b>Titanic: The Long Night</b></font> is a 1998 <font color="red"><i><b><u>romance </u></b></i></font>romance novel by Diane Hoh. It is an entirely <font color="red"><i><b><u>fictional</u></b></i></font> story set aboard on the <font color="red"><i><b><u>real</u></b></i></font> ship, Titanic.

    The plot centers around <font color="red"><i><b><u>two</u></b></i></font> main aspects. The first is the story of Elizabeth Farr, who is on the Titanic with her parents on the voyage to New York City, on her way to marry a man she doesn't want to marry, Alan Reed. While on the ship, she has <font color="red"><i><b><u>frequent</u></b></i></font> discussions with her parents about wanting to go to college and not wanting to marry Alan, but they refuse to let her make her <font color="red"><i><b><u>own</u></b></i></font> decisions. While on ship, she meets Maxwell Whittaker, the son of the rich Whittaker family, and falls in love with him, against the will of her parents.
    
    The plot also deals with the story of Kathleen Hanrahan, a girl who boards in Queenstown, Ireland. She falls in love with a man named Patrick "Paddy" Kelleher. She is also forced to take care of two <font color="red"><i><b><u>small</u></b></i></font> kids, Kevin and Bridey, whose caretaker is not paying attention to them.
    
    On the night the Titanic crashes into the iceberg, Elizabeth forgets all of her troubles when she realizes that she has to leave Max and her father behind on the ship while it sinks. She gets in Lifeboat Number 6 with her mother, Nola.
    
    Meanwhile, Katie wakes up in her <font color="red"><i><b><u>third class</u></b></i></font> cabin all by herself. She finds Paddy and he takes her, Kevin and Bridey up to the boat deck, where they find Paddy's brother Brian. Brian refuses to get in a lifeboat, and instead opts to stay behind encouraging other people to get in boats before it is too late. Katie and Paddy get in a lifeboat while Brian stays behind.
    
    Max and Elizabeth's father, still on the ship, retire in the gymnasium, until Max goes outside. The ship suddenly starts to plunge into the water and Max is washed off, presumably dead.
    
    While Elizabeth, Nola, Katie, Paddy and the rest of the people in the lifeboats watch, the RMS Titanic goes under water with more than 1,500 people in it. After floating all night, the boats are picked up by the RMS Carpathia. While on the ship, Elizabeth finds Max in the hospital room. Katie and Paddy are <font color="red"><i><b><u>less fortunate</u></b></i></font> however, and have to face it that Brian is dead.
    
    When they get to New York, Elizabeth goes to Vassar college and marries Max, while Paddy becomes a writer and marries Katie.</p>
