<h3>Planting and Preparing to grow your rice</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Buy Seeds</h4>
  <ol>
  <li>Buy rice seeds from any nursery or farmers supply market. <br>
    There are six basic kinds of rice seed to pick from:</li>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Long-grain. This sort of rice yields grains that are light and fluffy. It is mostly a tad bit drier than other types of rice.</li>
      <li>Medium-grain. This variety is moist, tender, somewhat sticky, and slightly creamy when cooked. It has the same feel as long-grain.</li>
      <li>Short-grain. When prepared, short-grain rice turns out to be soft and sticky. It’s also somewhat sweeter – this is the rice to use for sushi.</li>
      <li>Sweet. This rice is occasionally termed sticky rice, and is mushy when cooked. It’s frequently used for frozen goods.</li>
      <li>Aromatic. This kind of rice has added aroma and fragrance than other types. This variety includes Jasmine, Basmati, Red, and Black Japonica.</li>
      <li>Arborio. This kind becomes creamy with a chewy center after cooking. It’s used mostly for risotto and other Italian meals.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>  

<h4>Step 2: Select your planting site</h4>
<ol type="1">						<!--type="1"	The list items will be numbered with numbers (default)-->
  <li>Ensure the earth/ground in the area you’re planting has a little acidic clay for the best outcomes.</li>
  <li>Anywhere you plant, ensure that you have a dependable water source and a plan to drain that water when time comes to harvest.</li>
  <li>You can similarly insert your rice seeds in plastic buckets with the same soil.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 3: Prepping land and seeds</h4>
<ol type="A">						<!--type="A"	The list items will be numbered with uppercase letters-->
  <li>Get a minimum of 1 to 2 ounces (28.5 to 56.5 g) of rice seeds to scatter. </li>
  <li>Immerse the seeds in water to prepare them for planting, letting them soak for a good 12 hours but no longer than 36 hours.</li>
  <li>Take out the seeds from the water after that.</li>
    <ul> 
      <li>When your seeds are soaking, strategize where and in what way you want to plant them.</li>
      <li>Think to build troughs and blocking the ends so that the water continues to be contained and blocked.</li>
      <li>That being said, the rice field doesn’t have to be flooded, it just needs to remain wet.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>

<h4>Step 4: Planting seeds</h4>
<ol type="a">						<!--type="a"	The list items will be numbered with lowercase letters-->
  <li>Place the rice seeds all over the ground, in the course of the fall or spring season.</li>
  <li>Clear out weed plants, prepare the beds, and smoothen out the soil.</li>
  <li>If you are using buckets, fill them with a minimum of 6 inches (15 cm) of damp soil.</li>
  <li>At that moment, insert the rice seeds.</li>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>It is important to remember that the space requires to be waterlogged. It’s considerably easier to flood limited reduced spaces than one large paddy field. If you’re planting outdoors, using some seed beds will be easier to cope and sustain.</li>
      <li>If you plant in the winter season, make sure to remove the weeds when springtime comes. The rice seeds require all the nutrients and soil area they can get.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<h4>Step 5: Plant adequately apart</h4>
<ol type="I">						<!--type="I"	The list items will be numbered with uppercase roman numbers-->
  <li>Thin, or space out, the rice seeds to prevent crowding.</li>
  <li>For best results, thin out the seedlings no more than 4 inches (10.2 cm) apart in rows that range between 9 to 12 inches (22.9 to 30.5 cm) apart.</li>
  <li>Allow the seeds to grow up to 7 inches (17.8 cm) tall, which takes on average of about one month.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 6: Be patient. Drain, Flood, Drain!</h4>
<ol type="i">						<!--type="i"	The list items will be numbered with lowercase roman numbers-->
  <li>Wait for the rice grains to mature. This will take almost 3 or 4 months; during this time, they can go up to 17 inches high.</li>
  <li>Allow for the water dry out or remove any extra water prior to removing the rice for harvesting.</li>
  <li>Over the next two weeks, they’ll go from green to gold in color – that’s when you know they’re prepared.</li>
</ol>
